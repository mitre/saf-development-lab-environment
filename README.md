# saf-development-lab-environment

This lab is a GitHub environment that makes it quick and easy for you to start learning and working on executing your own InSpec profiles.

## Overview of the Lab

The repository is setup to be very low overhead, we use a simple `build-lab.sh` script to quickly add the tools you need to get started easily, along with two containers to act as testing targets. You can modify this as needed when working in your codespace, but remember to use git configuration management if you need to persist changes beyond the life of one Codespace.
